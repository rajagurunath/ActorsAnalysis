That was a calm bday and thank you all for making it special for me. I heard some of you involved yourself lending hands for underprivileged and thatâ€™s the best thing you guys gave me and am happy I was able to inspire few on that. Sorry that I couldnâ€™t reply everyone in person but all your love and wishes means a lot to me. Thanks for being there always with all those unconditional love. Letâ€™s start the next year with better hopes and kindness for each other. Happy newyear guys ðŸ˜Š
