What we spend on a weekend or over a treat meal can mean so much to this little life. It’s definitely not about how much we contribute but If we care to pause a bit and make a little difference. Baby Pranav is a little fighter who is going to be there for a really long time, making people around him happy again. Prayers and love to the littlen one and strength to his mother.
