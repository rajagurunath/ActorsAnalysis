So there has been situations where I refused to be a part of this man’s show when I was in channel and now I am unconditionally apologetic for being so judgmental and it’s unfortunate am getting to know you in person this late but better late than never😊 thank you Jagan na, vaan, Kavin&Vyasa for having us over❤️ and the welcome note is the sweetest, making me realise what a mean kid I was to our guests🙈 we should do this more with more food and love🤗
