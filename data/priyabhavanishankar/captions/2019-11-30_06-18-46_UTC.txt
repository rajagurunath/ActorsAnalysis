This picture puts a smile on my face every time, like I am restoring my energyğŸ˜ŠKeep taking time for yourself until you are you again and the universe will eventually fill you up with happiness. Itâ€™s ok to be stagnant or to be swift, to be fast or to be slow, itâ€™s absolutely ok to be whatever you are, just make sure you are true to yourself and kind to othersğŸ¤—
