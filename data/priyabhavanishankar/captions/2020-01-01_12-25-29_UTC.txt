Overwhelmed with all the love!
2019 was full of love strength and lots of beautiful memories both personally and professionally😊Looking forward to making more of it in the days to come. PROFESSIONALLY, Over the years slowly  steadily I have found myself doing what I love the most and I have never been more inclined and rooted about my work. Excited about the releases we have lined up for the coming months😊 PERSONALLY, faces in these pictures are constants. They are home. They are family 😊 this particular birthday was made more than perfect by my 2 year old nephew❤️ @rajvel.rs The most valuable gift you gave me is the strength you let me build within myself😊 
Finally all my love and gratitude to each and everyone at work place, gym, in social media and media houses who took their time to share such nice words on my bday. Forever indebted to this kind of love😊 let’s have a happy year ahead and spread love 😊
