Happy birthday dude☺️ when I cried you were there holding me tight. You heard me and never decided for me. Holding my hands you always saw a light for me at the end of the tunnel. So enough trouble already done for this life and the plan is to let you chill from here, smile & celebrate through life☺️ we love you daddy ❤️
