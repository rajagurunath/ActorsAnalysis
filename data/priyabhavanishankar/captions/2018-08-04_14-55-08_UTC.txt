If anything I would want in future is, the smile my mother has on her face. The sheer happiness she derives by taking care of her mom and dadğŸ˜Šand its a blessing to hear that â€˜Good Nightâ€™ from my paati every night and we only pray for a more happier and healthier â€˜Good Morningâ€™ from her the next dayğŸ˜Š we are more than blessed to celebrate our most handsome thathaâ€™s 86th birthdayğŸ˜Š Elders at home are definitely a blessing and teach your kids by treating them rightğŸ˜Š
