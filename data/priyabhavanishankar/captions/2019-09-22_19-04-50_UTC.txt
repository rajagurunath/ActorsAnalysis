All that matters🤗 So we’ve known each other forever through everything, all good and bad for past 16+ years & it’s amazing to have someone to stand by your side saying ‘the moment you decided to be stupid you need to be strong to face it’ and not everyone is blessed with friends saying you are wrong when you’re wrong. Friendship is not just about saving your shit whatever crap you do but reflecting your own self to you when you’re wrong and helps you be a better person, am blessed to have you, inspite of what an irritating person you are. PS : your mobile is with me 🤦🏻‍♀️Cheeeeers to our foreverness🤗  #16+years #forever #friends @jayanthearivuselvam
