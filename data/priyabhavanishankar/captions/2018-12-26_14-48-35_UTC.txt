Bumped into this pic! I made it to 4 different weddings that particular morning so am not sure which couple made me look this happy for them ðŸ˜€ all the four weddings were of love struck close to heart couples and it was so beautiful to see them take a life officially together from that point. Love is beautiful and 2 families coming together in a wedding is more beautiful! Thanks to the one who clicked me amidst that. I look happily beautiful ðŸ¤—
