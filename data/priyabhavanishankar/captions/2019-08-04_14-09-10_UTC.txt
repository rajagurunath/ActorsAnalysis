****Long post alert****
@arshadh_az @archu_90 @manojgupta5 @navinr89 @jayanthearivuselvam You guys have been with me through everything. LITERALLY everything that’s been happening and however messed up I get, I can buckle up myself & keep my head in place because of you guys. I owe that forever though I don’t express it much. @rajvel.rs the bond that we share inspite of everything, it just cannot be termed under one or any form of abstract noun😊 there’s no ‘one word’ to describe what we have and I don’t care to name it to this world. Ironically Down after 10 years even if we have a different life and different paths I would still know you have my back and I can screw Up big time and come crying to you😊 @jayanthearivuselvam so it’s been forever & let’s do it forever 🤗  its all cheesy enough already🤢 Let me stop 😶 So posting this only because my insta handle has been idle for 4 days now🤷🏻‍♀️ no strong feelings though. Love you all ❤️ #friendslikefamily #friendsmorethanfamily #strength
