My heart goes to this beautiful country! The place that has seen me in my most happiest phase and the place that healed me at my worst. Each time it looked different, each time more beautiful. The disaster being beyond control, the helpless wildlife and picturesque places burning down in fire is such a pain. Prayers and bounce back more strong and splendid my beautiful second home! #prayforaustralia
