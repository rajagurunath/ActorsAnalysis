So when i decided to do Cambodia that noon and booked to fly that night there was this patient guy Vikash from @touronholidays who took care of everything from there with a zero planning time. For someone like me who travels in every short break found, your @touronholidays team is going to be one of the basics 🤩 sure to plan more crazy trips soon and the local guides there were a delight and an absolute sweetheart who could lit up even an average day. Couldn’t love Raksa and David any lesser and with what a lovely gesture the guys sent us off. Spl mention to David for that incredible off beat day 🤪 @asean_angkor_guide sending all love to you guys from Chennai ❤️
