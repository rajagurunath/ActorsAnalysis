You were there through EVERYTHING. And you are going to be there for another eternity 💁🏻‍♀️ and it’s funny how we have spent more than half our entire lifetime with each other and it’s leaving me hopeless for the rest of our future 🤣 how unfortunate it is I’m not able to bring in that ‘special’ cake because of this quarantine. First thing first soon 🤗 happy birthday thala @jayanthearivuselvam 🥳😇
