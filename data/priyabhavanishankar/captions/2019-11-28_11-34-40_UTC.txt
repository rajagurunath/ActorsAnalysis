So the best thing that happened to me in the recent past is my gym @brigadefitness There has been days where I just wanted to lock myself up in my room, not to face people, stress eat, and repeat. My trainer @jeevz24 made sure I turn my pain into power. He never let my bad days stop me from hitting the gym. Infact surprisingly I found my peace in there and there has been days where I pushed myself to workout inspite of some crazy shoot schedules. And I have found some wonderful people in here who makes this place all the more fun and interesting to hit in everyday. never in my life I thought I would say my gym is my happy place. Cheeeers to all the amazing trainers and the entire Brigade team on their 2nd year and to the years to come🤗Thank you Jeeva for making me a  better version of myself. If not for you, working out would have been a nightmare for me forever. and I promise I’ll try to watch what I eat at least from now 🙇🏻‍♀️🤘🏼
