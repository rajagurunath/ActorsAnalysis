@actormaddy From a fan who has looked upto his compelling positive aura, to someone who can (rightfully not stalking anymore) reach out to him in person to get a hint of that warmth during tough times, somewhere in between I grew up and my love and admiration for this man keeps growing❤️ happy birthday Maddy! Wish you more more and more love happiness and health . You keep being awesome and I’ll keep being that fan girl forever🤗 btw 50? Seriously? Pheww! You fine wine 🤗🔥 #happybirthdaymaddy
