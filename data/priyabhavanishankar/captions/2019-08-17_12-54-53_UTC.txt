That’s a wrap of ‘Mafia’ for me😊 It was a fun cheerful and a super fast quick shoot. We are still wondering about the capacity of this 3 pound super special brain of @karthicknaren_m  @arunvijayno1 You are a surprise package of kindness dedication perseverance talent positivity and an unexpected friend I made at work🤗 It never felt like we were shooting at a stretch for a month and I’m gonna miss everyone in my routine now. @rtheprotagonist @gokul_benoy @ashokstylist27 Renu and the whole bunch of wonderful asst directors u all made it more special and memorable😊 Mafia will always remain close to my heart for so many obvious reasons. Love you all ❤️ PS: inspite of all the fun it’s still a serious movie 😐 #Mafia
