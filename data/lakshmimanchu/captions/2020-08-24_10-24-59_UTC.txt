Thank you, Sam, for nominating me for #GrowWithMe. Nivi and I are all set to plant these seedlings and we're exploring new ways to grow our own food.

Plants are beneficial to us in so many different ways. They provide us with oxygen and food sources! I genuinely believe that we are what we eat, and this pandemic has taught us a great deal about healthy living and eating food that nourishes our bodies. We can manage to live without a whole lot of things, but not without food so I feel extremely proud to be able to grow my own food.
