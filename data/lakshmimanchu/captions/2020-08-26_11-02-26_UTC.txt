I truly believe in seeing the best in everything. Although we’ve all been in lockdown, I’m extremely grateful that God gave me this time to spend with my little Apple. I remember when I had to leave her behind as I went for shoots, but the lockdown has helped me bond with her more than ever!

Always focus on the positive ✨
