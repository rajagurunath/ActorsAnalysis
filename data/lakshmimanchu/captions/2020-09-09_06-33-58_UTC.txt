Congratulations to the Indian Media channels for making the most money out of the death of #SSR and by ruining a family that served that our country. I guess conscience these days is a luxury. I want to know if you really cared about SSR or was it just the money that you are enjoying at their expense or the fame. This country has been built & supported by strong women over the years and with the current scenario it is important and by important, I mean we need to preach that - We should all see gender as a whole spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals. #JusticeForRhea #RheaChakraborty #LakshmiUnfiltered
