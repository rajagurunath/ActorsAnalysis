Spending time with your family is always a blessing and I genuinely love it when the family comes together for special occasions. Hereâ€™s what the Manchu family was up to during this yearâ€™s Vinayaka Chaturthi festivities.Â 

I hope and pray that Lord Ganesha showers you with positivity and tons of blessings!
