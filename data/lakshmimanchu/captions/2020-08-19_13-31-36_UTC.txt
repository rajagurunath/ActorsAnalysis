This Ganesh Chaturthi let’s bring home Lord Ganesha, the God of new beginnings and the remover of obstacles. 🙏
Thank you @santoshkumarjoginipally for this beautiful seed Ganesha!
A seed of goodness to sow in for our future and cherish festivals without harming our environment. 
This year, as I do every year, I will celebrate this auspicious festival in an eco-friendly way to help protect and support Mother Nature. I'm trying to do my bit, are you?
