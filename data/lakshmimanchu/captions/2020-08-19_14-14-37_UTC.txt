As we celebrate #WorldPhotographyDay, I would like to take a moment to talk about a few of my favourite photographers. They are true artists, their work speaks volumes and I can spend hours admiring their creativity. There are plenty of other photographers that I truly admire but I thought I could use this opportunity to share a few with you today!
