In conversation with Dr. Kondaveti Newton, someone who I trust immensely for my spiritual growth, someone who fills me up with positivity. It’s my earnest request to each and one of you to help others in trouble. You have the power to not end your ‘life story’ like this, you have the chance to be rescued and the help and support to fight another day. #LakshmiUnfiltered #WorldSuicidePreventionDay #SayNoToSuicide #SuicideIsNotTheOption
