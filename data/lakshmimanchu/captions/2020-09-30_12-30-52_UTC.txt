A picture says a thousand words, but this picture only makes me realise how much my mother loves me. My greatest teacher, best therapist and my one and only BEST FRIEND! Her arms are more comforting than anyone else's, all that I am or hope to be, I owe to my beautiful and flawless mother! I love you!😍✨🙏🏼
