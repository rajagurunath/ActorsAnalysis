The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things. A very #HappyBirthday to the fearless @narendramodi Ji! We support and stand with you in solidarity, for you have the voice and the vision to stand up for what is right for us which is of the people, for the people, by the people. A leader who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way. May you have a healthy long life and be blessed in utmost abundance! ✨🙏🏼
