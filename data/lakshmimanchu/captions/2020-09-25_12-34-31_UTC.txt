From being a little child, playing on his lap and listening to his songs, to seeing how Humble a man he was, with the sweetest voice that could mesmerize anyone. He was very giving and always taught me life lessons which today till date are with me. I am extremely saddened to know that such a Great yet Simple man has departed us. My heartfelt condolences and prayers to him and his family. His songs touched many and may his voice live on forever! Uncle you were a leader par excellence. We will miss you! Sending love ðŸ¤—
