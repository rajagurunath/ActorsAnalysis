Mommmmmy it’s ur day and I can’t tell  you how much I love you ❤️❤️ Behind all our stories is our mothers story because hers is where yours begins ! Thankyou mom for writing my story and being my strength throughout the journey. You have taught me how to be selfless , kind , to understand love , to be a fearless independent girl and most importantly to be balanced. I cannot ever thankyou enough but I can promise to be a best version of myself with each passing day. Love love love you ❤️❤️😘
