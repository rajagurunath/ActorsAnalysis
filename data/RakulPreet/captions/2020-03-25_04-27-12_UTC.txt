Happy Ugadi to all of you! I know we cannot celebrate with family and friends at this point due to the unfortunate situation but letâ€™s be hopeful and take all precautions like social distancing and hygiene so that we can have a bigger celebration as a country together in days to come. #stayhomestaysafe
