Never imagined I’d be watching The Lion King while I’m sitting at home! 
What a dream come true, all thanks to #DisneyPlusHotstarPremiere. 
Now that’s another thing checked off of my bucket list, yay!
With Disney+ hotstar launching tomorrow, April 3rd, I’m going to have my hands full!
What will you be watching first when Disney+ hotstar releases tomorrow?
