Today, we are at war with a virus that is ravaging communities. We need to come and fight as one to win the war on the Coronavirus. And the first step to that is good health - for each one of us and our families.
With medical services overloaded, and expert care already stretched thin, it is extremely important to get the right medical assistance, and get it on time. 
With the Swasth app, there is a safe way for you to get a test for Covid-19 done, check the availability of beds in the nearest hospital, or even get medicines delivered to you - all this from the safety of your home, using just your phone.

Log on to www.swasth.app - stay safe and keep your family safe. “Toh Aao, Saath Chale, Swasth Chale! Kyunki Sabse Pehle Swasth”
