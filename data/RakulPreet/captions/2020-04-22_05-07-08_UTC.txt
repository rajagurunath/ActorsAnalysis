Get lost in the beauty of nature to find yourself ! ❤️. We haven’t really been responsible enough to nurture the planet that feeds us all. It’s time we realise the same and strive to be better citizens of earth. They say nature has its ways to teach a lesson , maybe this is a warning to preserve our habitat. If we truly surrendered in Earths intelligence we could rise up rooted like trees ! ❤️❤️ Happy Earth Day 🌍
