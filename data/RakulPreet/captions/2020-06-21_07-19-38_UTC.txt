From helping me take my first steps to pushing me to do everything, for not taking no for an answer ever, for helping us push boundaries, for making us fearless and strong , from being childlike with me even today to being my guide through all things in life, you have been my BIGGEST SUPPORT, my constant , my inspiration , my idol . Thankyou for instilling in me the wisdom to take on the world with confidence and on my terms . A super proud daughter of the strongest daddy ❤️❤️ I love you ♾ .. #happyfathersday pappppiiii 😘😘
