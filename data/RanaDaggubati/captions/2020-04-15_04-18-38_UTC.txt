A few years back have done a story on a theatre group in Hyderabad called Surabhi. The group, known for mythological plays with unique special effects and brilliant lighting schemes, comprises members of a single-family put up a performance every week, and this tradition has been going on for nearly 128 years. Meticulously applied make-up, colourful backdrops, lustrous costumes and magic created through innovative tricks are the forte of Surabhi. It creates a magical effect and transports the audience to a make-believe world. At present, due to Corona Virus, the 50 members of the family have lost their job and going through the worst phase of their lives. The group consist of many kids and older people who are deprived of their basic necessity due to this lockdown going on in India. Surabhi theatre is striving to survive through this difficult time and needs all our support and help.
