Was a pleasure working with you ❤️Posted @withrepost • @shriya.pilgaonkar Wrapped shoot for ‘ Haathi Mere Saathi ‘ / ‘Aranya ‘ / ‘ Kadan ‘ ( in the three languages respectively ) 🙃
I feel incredibly grateful to be a part of this film and all that it stands for . @ranadaggubati, you were a student on set and not a star . That’s so rare .  I’m in awe of your commitment & passion towards cinema and your desire to give back . This is a grand vision and I was working alongside an incredibly dedicated cast and crew . This was also my first time filming in three languages ( Tamil, Telugu, Hindi) which was a whole new challenge in itself but very exciting . Thank you Eros and Prabhu Sir for this opportunity 🙏🏼🐘
