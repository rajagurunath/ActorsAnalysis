Got a glimpse of the exciting stuff being showcased tomorrow at Maker Faire Hyderabad. Soldered this custom-made 'Suppandi' circuit board! 
Thrilled to see Telangana State Government building institutions like TWorks and supporting events like MakerFaire Hyderabad. Make the most of your Sunday, learn a new skill and build something exciting from drones to soaps at MFH2019! @Tworkshyd @MakerFaireHyd @sujaikarampuri @ackalive
